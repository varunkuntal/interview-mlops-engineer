### **How to share your results?**
- [ ] Clone this repository and create your own branch to work on.

- [ ] Once you are ready, create a pull request with your code.


### **Evaluation:**
- [ ] There should be **at least** one test written and the README file should include instructions on how to execute it.
- [ ] You should provide clear documentation of the API, you can use Swagger or any other format.
- [ ] README file should include clear instructions on how to deploy / start the application.
- [ ] No crashes or bugs.
- [ ] Code is easily understood and communicative (eg. comments, variable names, etc).
